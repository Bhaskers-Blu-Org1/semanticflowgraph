**Create semantic dataflow graphs of data science code.**

The package is intended to be used with the [Data Science Ontology](https://github.com/ibm/datascienceontology) as well as language-specific program analysis tools. Currently [Python](https://github.com/ibm/pyflowgraph) and [R](https://github.com/ibm/rflowgraph) are supported.

For more information, please see our recent [research paper](https://www.epatters.org/papers/#2018-semantic-enrichment) on "Teaching machines to understand data science code by semantic enrichment of dataflow graphs".
